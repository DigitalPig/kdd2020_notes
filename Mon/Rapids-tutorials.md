[NVTabular based Workflow](https://youtu.be/cFni0jzflA0)

* [NVTabular](https://github.com/nvidia/NVTabular) provides a workflow object so that a lot of pre-processing can be done in GPU memory with a workflow

[Single Cell RNA using Rapids](https://youtu.be/kakqW1ac-Gw)

* cuDf -> pandas; cupy -> numpy
* mainly examples for scapy (gene processing)
* T-SNE/UMAP Clustering method is faster, those functions are in `cuml` package
* Louvain (graph community detection algorithm)

[cuDF with a Parking Example](https://youtu.be/dRE-8q9K1RY) 

* GPU needs to be >Pascal 
* Mainly cuDF examples
* Interesting to see a [jupyter notebook plugin](https://github.com/pbugnion/gmaps) for plotting the map
* cuGraph to find out the distances between the parking space and the destinations
