Software used is [DGL](https://www.dgl.ai/). 

## Hands on tutorial Part 1

[Repo](https://github.com/dglai/KDD20-Hands-on-Tutorial) and [Video](https://youtu.be/OEBk_HvKNcQ).

* Brief introduction of DGL package. What it can do with the graph.

## Scale the graph

In this tutorial, [GraphSAGE](https://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage/) ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216)) algorithm is used to generate the representation of nodes. GraphSAGE is one of common covolutional graph learning algorithm.

Also, I found another interesting tool called [StellaGraph](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for graph based algorithm.
